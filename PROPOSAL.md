# Proposal: Space Invaders

Author: Jonathan He

---
For my CS 126 project I would like to create a game that mimics the 
functionality of the iconic Arcade game, Space Invaders. 

I chose to mimic this  game because I played this game as a kid and programming 
it using C++ and Cinder would be a fun experience. 

For the libraries I would use, I would probably use a physics library in 
https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp to get the correct movements of the 
player and the blasts. Similar to how the snake game operates, I would imagine 
the GUI to look similar using Cinder. Also, to get the realism of the invaders,
I would probably use the Box2D library, https://github.com/sansumbrella/suBox2D.

In the first week, I will set up the project in cinder and take in all the
proper libraries and CMake Files to allow this project to build. Then, by the 
second week, I would get the proper GUI and movement framework done along with
the score calculation. By week 3, I would brush up the GUI and add sound effects
to the necessary components to the game.

If I have extra time, I would like to add some power-ups: speed, deflecting
shots etc.
